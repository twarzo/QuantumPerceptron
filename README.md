# QuantumPerceptron

### Problem Statement
Implement a Perceptron using quantum gates in Q#.

### Prerequisites
- Programming Background, preferably C#
- Basic Knowledge of Quantum gates, matrices, and unitary operations
-	Q# knowledge is addon. 

### Technology Used
-	C#
-	Q#

### Instructions
- There should support of running C# on system. [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) can help you in this. 
- To run Q#, Quantum Develop Kit is required. For Visual Studio, the SDK kit can be downloaded from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.DevKit). There is extension available for the same in VS Code as well. 

- Length of Input Vector should be in terms of 2^n.
- Iteration value is just to improve the probability of the quantum state. 

#### Inputs
- Number of Bits: 4  
- Input Vector : 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 1
- Weight Vector: 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1
- Iterations: 8196
